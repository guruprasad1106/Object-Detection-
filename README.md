# Object Detection

## Overview

**Object Detection** is a project that identifies and classifies objects within images or video frames using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system draws bounding boxes around detected objects and labels them with their corresponding classes. Object Detection is widely used in areas like autonomous driving, video surveillance, and image recognition.

## Features

- Detects multiple objects in images or videos.
- Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models for object detection (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN).
- Supports real-time detection from a camera or video feed.
- Allows customization of detection thresholds and output formats.
- Outputs bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Python 3.x**: Required to run the object detection scripts.
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **PyTorch or TensorFlow**: Depending on the deep learning framework used.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: (Optional) For visualizing the detection output.
